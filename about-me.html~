		<p id="About-Me-text"> My name is Elle Huang. I was born in Taishan, China, a small village outside of Guangzhou, and grew up in various parts of the world. It was through my parents that I developed an appreciation for language and culture. I speak fluently three dialects of Chinese and I am proficient in German. </p>
		<p id="About-Me-text"> As an undergraduate student majoring in Business and German at the University of Notre Dame, I have a passion for social entrepreneurship and micro-enterprises. I am specifically interested in sustainable economic development in urban slums throughout the world. My background in language leads me to examine the role of developed nations such as the United States and Germany. </p>
